<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

  

The Typing Game is a fun and interactive web-based game where users can practice and improve their typing speed and accuracy. It presents users with a series of random words or phrases that they must type as quickly and accurately as possible within a specified time limit.

  

### Built With

  

-  **Frontend**: React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The current version of the application is focused on the frontend, utilizing React for its dynamic and responsive design.

  

-  **Backend** (Planned): Express.js - We plan to develop the backend using Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, to handle server-side logic and routing.

  

-  **Database** (Planned): PostgreSQL - For data storage, we are looking forward to integrating PostgreSQL, an advanced open-source relational database, which will manage the application's data efficiently and securely.

  

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and expand our application's features and capabilities!
